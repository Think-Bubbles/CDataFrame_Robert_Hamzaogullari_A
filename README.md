Welcome to our CDataFrame project â€“ a C-based data frame that facilitates data manipulation, thanks to our custom-made library, including many different functions to allow the user to efficiently manipulate data. This project aims to emulate some of the functionalities of the famous Pandas library.

## Features

Our CDataFrame project offers a powerful solution for data manipulation in the C programming language. Built to streamline repetitive data processing tasks, it provides functionalities akin to those found in popular spreadsheet software like "LibreOffice Calc" or "MS Excel", but with the flexibility and efficiency of a programming language.
For the moment we have implemented two aspects of our final goal:
- The colums which allow us to stock the data the user wants (for the moment we have restricted it to whole numbers but we plan on generalising it for other types of data)
- Half of the CDataFrame, which basically consists of functionalities that allow us to create our CDataFrame (and that is a dynamic array of pointers to columns). As of right now we can create the CDataFrame and display it to the user.

## Getting Started 



## Installation

TIn order to use this program, please insure that you have the following installed
- [Clion](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/clion/download/#section=windows) Popular IDE for C

## Known bugs 

Be very careful with the user inputs as there are pretty much no secured entries.
For checking any values superior or lower than, those functionalities work when it comes to manipulating individual columns, but when working with the CDataFrame as a whole they do not function properly
Furthermore there are a few missing functionalities such as adding / removing lines and columns.
